  <p class='py-4 pb-1 wow slideInLeft'>The aim of this Alumni Management System project is to build a system that will be able to manage alumni data of a college and provide easy access to the same. Alumni of a college generally stay in touch with their immediate friends but find it hard to stay connected with other college mates. Contact between alumni can be used to forge business connections and to gain references or insight in a new field. New college students will be initially given a student login ID. Access to the system can help them in building connections to help them in their projects or for placements.</p>
  <p class='py-2 wow slideInRight'>The system will automatically list all college students as alumni on their graduation and their account status will be transferred from the student module to the alumni module. Users will be prompted to update social network details such as their Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter handles.Users can also choose to automatically share new updates in work status from their LinkedIn profile. Users will also be able to share and promote their business Facebook pages or Twitter handles through the system.This single system will be able to bypass the requirement of any other Alumni organization. The system can track user location as given by the user. Once the system notices that more than 10 alumni are available in the same city it can notify all of them about the possibility of a meet.</p>
  <p class='py-2 wow fadeInUp'>Alumni will also be able to provide public posts on the system about possible job opportunities or other college related news. Since it is unlikely that alumni will check the system frequently the system will be able collate all public posts and create a newsletter that can be emailed to all alumni.The system will also privacy features. Users can determine what information they want to share and also whom they want to share it with. For example users can choose to share their Facebook profile name and mobile number with alumni who graduated in the same year as them. They system will also have a chat feature which will enable alumni to chat without revealing their mobile number or personal e â€“ mail ID.</p>
